    <p class="paragraph__four">Clarity: BEM makes it clear which CSS styles apply to which parts of the HTML code, and makes it easy to understand and maintain.
        Reusability: BEM encourages the use of reusable blocks of code, which can be easily reused across different parts of a website or application.
        Scalability: BEM helps to maintain consistency across a large codebase, making it easier to scale and maintain large projects.
        Modularity: BEM allows you to separate the presentation and behavior of a component, making it easy to change the look and feel of a component without affecting its functionality.
        Namespacing: BEM provides a clear namespace for each element and modifier, preventing naming collisions and making it easy to keep track of your classes.</p>
